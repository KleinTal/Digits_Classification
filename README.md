# Digits_Classification
## Introduction
This repository contains code for building and evaluating deep learning models for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Two different approaches are explored: one using a simple dense neural network implemented with Keras, and another using a convolutional neural network (CNN) also implemented with Keras.

## File Structure
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the Keras dense neural network and CNN approach.
- `train.csv`: CSV file containing training data for the Keras dense neural network approach.
- `test.csv`: CSV file containing test data for the Keras dense neural network approach.

## Results
- The Keras dense neural network achieved an accuracy of **96.13%** on the test set.
- The CNN achieved an accuracy of **99.15%** on the test set.
